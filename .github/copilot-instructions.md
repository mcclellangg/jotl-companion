Ignore the contents of the `/dev` directory, these are notes for my purposes only.

This app uses Flask to render the site locally. However it is served via GitHub Pages (relevant documents for that are in `/docs`).

Think of `/docs` as our production environment, and Flask files as our development environment.

Styling on the frontend is handled by `Chota`. Our goal is to keep this app simple and stick to vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS where possible. Avoid introducing frontend frameworks.
